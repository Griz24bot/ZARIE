# TODO: Enhance Bot with Agent Isolation, Platform Binding, Fault Detection, Self-Repair, and Orchestration

## Step 1: Implement Platform Adapters
- [x] Create CoinbaseAdapter class in dynasty/agents.py
- [x] Create AlpacaAdapter class in dynasty/agents.py
- [x] Implement execute method for each adapter to handle trades

## Step 2: Create TradingAgent Class
- [x] Add TradingAgent class with platform binding (adapter)
- [x] Implement async run loop
- [x] Add fault detection (API failures, errors, latency)
- [x] Add self-repair method (reconnect, reset state, notify)

## Step 3: Refactor Main Loop to Async Orchestration
- [x] Update dynasty/main.py to use asyncio
- [x] Create agents for Coinbase and Alpaca
- [x] Use asyncio.gather() to run agents concurrently

## Step 4: Integrate with Existing Memory and Logging
- [x] Ensure agents use VaultLogger for logging
- [x] Integrate with BotMemory for learning

## Step 5: Test Agent Isolation and Concurrent Execution
- [x] Run the bot and verify agents run in parallel
- [x] Check for errors in logs

## Step 6: Verify Fault Detection and Repair
- [x] Simulate API failure and check repair mechanism
- [x] Ensure other agents continue unaffected

## Step 7: Integrate Telegram Alerts for DNS Failures and Mutation Triggers
- [x] Create alerts.py with Telegram bot integration
- [x] Add DNS failure alerts in AlpacaAdapter
- [x] Add mutation trigger alerts in TradingAgent
- [x] Add repair success/failure alerts

## Step 8: Simulate Full Outage and Recovery with Mutation Cascade
- [x] Add simulate_outage method in Orchestrator
- [x] Integrate mutation cascade on repeated failures
